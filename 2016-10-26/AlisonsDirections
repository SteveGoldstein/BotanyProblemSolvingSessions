The outline looks like this:
- Start with lcb.fa files created at the end of your last workshop
- Somehow (up to you) create versions of those files where sequence names are consistent. So instead of "1:4-6467 - /Users/metasequoia/Downloads/BotanyProblemSolvingSessions-master/data/Picea_abies.fa", the sequence would be called simply "Picea" in all of the lcb.fa files
- Convert .fa files to .nex (I did this in Geneious but could be done many ways)
- Run all .nex files through MrBayes
- Using Bucky, run mbsum to summarize MrBayes output per locus (from different runs)
- Run Bucky on the 21 lcbs & evaluate the output

Attached here are two directories: 
- one has the .nex files (after being renamed)
- one has the .in files that serve as input for Bucky (these are created during the mbsum step)
